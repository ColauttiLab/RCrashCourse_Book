# Advanced R

## Introduction

By now you have mastered the fundamentals of base R, visualizations, and data science! 

In this tutorial, we will cover some a few of the more advanced but extremely useful topics.

## Getting Started

Before beginning this tutorial, make sure you have installed these packages:

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages('rmarkdown')
install.packages('dplyr')
install.packages('knitr')
```

## R Markdown

R Markdown is a powerful format for quickly making high-quality reports of your analysis. You can embed code and all kinds of output, including graphs, and output them to a Word Document, PDF or website. In fact, all of our tutorial webpages are written in R Markdown, including this one!

Here we'll cover just the basics, but a complete guide to R Markdown is available online from [Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire and Garrett Grolemund](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). You can also check out the R Markdown documents that we use to make our tutorial websites on our GitHub Pages (the website files have .html extension and the R Markdown files have the same name with .Rmd extensions):

  * [Main Colautti Lab Resources Website](https://colauttilab.github.io/) and [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ColauttiLab/ColauttiLab.github.io)
  * [R Tutorials](https://colauttilab.github.io/RCrashCourse/1_fundamentals.html) and [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ColauttiLab/RCrashCourse)

### Cheat Sheet

There is a very [handy 2-page 'cheat sheet'](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) that you can print out to help you remember some of the main commands. I use R Markdown for all kinds of documents -- including course tutorials like this one -- so I have the 2-page cheat sheet printed out and taped to my wall next to my computer.

You can also access cheat sheets for R Markdown and several others R Studio also includes a number of cheat sheets under the *Help* menu: `Help -> Cheatsheets`


### Create

In RStudio: `File-> New-> R Markdown`

Choose `Document` from the left-hand side menu

Make sure `html` is selected

Then click `OK`

Very few elements are needed for a basic markdown file, and these are provided when you create a new file.

### YAML Header 

This is generated automatically when you make a new .Rmd file in RStudio. Depending on what options you choose, it might look something like this:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "Robert I. Colautti"
date: "January 20, 2019"
output: html_document
---
```

There are other options available for YAML, and you can includes a separate `_output.yml` to set other aspects of the layoug.

### Markdown

R Markdown is based on the [markdown language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which was created as a quick and easy way to encode formatted websites in a simple text document.

R Markdown has a few additions, including the ability to easily incorporate R code, graphs, and equations.

### Basic elements:

#### Plain text

Plain text is converted into paragraph format. 

To start a new paragraph, press *enter* twice, so to skip a line in the .Rmd file.

#### Formatted text

You can format text with `*` or `_`

`*italics*` or `_italics_`: *italics*

`**bold**` or `__bold__`: **bold**

Use greater-than sign for block quotes, eg. `> TIP: quote`

> TIP: quote

### Headers

Add headers with up to 6x `#` -- more headers = subheadings:

<h1> `# Header 1` </h1>

<h2> `## Sub-Header = Header 2` </h2>

<h3> `### Sub-Sub Header = Header 3` </h3>

<h4> `#### Sub-Sub-Sub Header = Header 4` </h4>

### Other Elements

`--` for short--dash (a.k.a. 'n-dash'): --

`---` for long --- dash (a.k.a. m-dash: ---

### Links

Links have a special format. The text you want the user to see goes in square brackets, followed immediately by the file or html link in regular brackets, with no space in between: 

`[Colautti Lab Website](https://colauttilab.github.io/)`:

[Colautti Lab Website](https://colauttilab.github.io/)

You can also use this with relative path names, for example to link a file in a folder called `images` inside of the project folder:

`[Linked .png file](./images/ColauttiLabLogo.png)`:

[Linked .png file](./images/ColauttiLabLogo.png)

### Images

Or you can embed the image directly by adding an exclamation point. You can leave the linked text blank or keep it to use as a caption.

`![Linked .png file](./images/ColauttiLabLogo.png)`:

![Linked .png file](./images/ColauttiLabLogo.png)

### Lists and tables

Lists are easy to create, simply start a line with `*` or `+` for _unordered_ lists or a number for _ordered_ lists. Add tab characters for sub-lists:

```{r, eval=F}
+ Unordered list item 1  
* Item 2  
    + sub item 2.1  
    * sub item 2.2  
* Item 3  
```

+ Unordered list item 1
* Item 2
    * sub item 2.1
    * sub item 2.2
* Item 3

```{r, eval=F}
1. Ordered list item 1  
2. Item 2  
    + sub item 2.1  
    * sub item 2.2  
3. Item 3  
```

1. Ordered list item 1  
2. Item 2  
    + sub item 2.1  
    * sub item 2.2  
3. Item 3 

The fun thing about ordered lists is the numbers you use don't really matter -- R Markdown will automatically start at 1 and increase for each item.

```{r, eval=F}
1. Ordered list item 1  
1. Item 2  
    + sub item 2.1  
    * sub item 2.2  
1. Item 3  
```

1. Ordered list item 1  
1. Item 2  
    + sub item 2.1  
    * sub item 2.2  
1. Item 3 

Tables are added using vertical pipe `|` to denote columns, and a line of horizontal dashes to separate the title of the table, and dashes with pipes to separate the header row from the rest of the table. For example, this code:

```{r, eval=F}
Tables 
-----------------------
  
Date  | Length  | Width
------|---------|------
09/09/09 | 14 | 27
10/09/09 | 15 | 29
11/09/09 | 16 | 31
```

Produces this output:

Tables 
-----------------------
  
Date  | Length  | Width
------|---------|------
09/09/09 | 14 | 27
10/09/09 | 15 | 29
11/09/09 | 16 | 31

### Embed R Code

Embed R code inline using the back-tick \` character: `embedded code`

Note that the back-tick is not the single quotation mark. It's often on the same key as ~ on North American keyboards.

You can add larger blocks of code (multiple lines) using three back ticks \`  and r in curly brackets. Then add three more tick marks after the code chunk:


```{r, eval=F}
#     ```{r}
#      <<your code goes here>>
#     ```
```

`Ctl-Alt-i` is a nice shortcut in R Studio for adding code chunks quickly

#### Code Chunk Names

You can name your code chunks, which becomes useful when making custom packages or other knitr uses. The name is added after the `r` separated only by spaces. The name cannot contain spaces. E.g. ````{r code-chunk-name, eval=F}`

```{r}

```


#### Suppress code

You can use different options for your R code chunks, as shown on the cheatsheet. Three main ones are:

  * `eval=F` -- show the code but don't run it.
  * `include=F` -- run the code but don't show it and and don't produce any output, plots, messages or warnings.
  * `echo=F` -- don't show the code but run it and include any output, plots, messages and warnings.

### Dynamic tables

Making tables from data is a bit more complicated. For example, if we wanted to summarize the `FallopiaData.csv` data, we could read in the file and then summarize with dplyr as we did in the [Data Science Tutorial](5_datascience.html):

```{r, message=F}
library(dplyr)

Fallo<-read.csv(
  "https://colauttilab.github.io/RCrashCourse/FallopiaData.csv")

SumTable<-Fallo %>% 
  group_by(Taxon,Scenario,Nutrients) %>%
  summarize(Mean=mean(Total), SD=sd(Total)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Mean))

print(SumTable)
```

The output is legible but not very attractive for a final report. To make it look better, we can use the `kable` function from the `knitr` package:

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(SumTable, caption = "Summary Table")
```

### Embed Graphs

Use R code to embed graphs.

```{r, echo=F}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r, message=F}
qplot(rnorm(100))
```


### Options for header

```{r eval=FALSE}
output:
  html_document: # Add options for html output
    toc: true # Add table of contents (TOC)
    number_sections: true # Add section numbers
    toc_float: # Have TOC floating at the side
      collapsed: false # Expand subsections
```

### Content as tabs

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Quarterly Results {.tabset}

### By Product

(Product tab content)

### By Region

(Region tab content)
```

Looks like this:

### Quarterly Results {.tabset}

#### By Product

(Product tab content)

#### By Region

(Region tab content)


### Equations

Insert equations using LaTeX equations, which come in two forms:

1. Use single dollar signs for in-line equations, like `$Y = X$`, which will print as $Y = X$

2. Use double dollar signs on a new line for full-line equations, like `$$Y = X$$`:

$$Y = X $$
You can use a variety of Greek letters by using the backslash character `\`. For upper-case Greek letters, just use an upper-case letter in the spelling. For example:

  * `\lambda`: $\lambda$ OR `\Lambda` : $\Lambda$
  * `\gamma`: $\gamma$ OR `\Gamma`: $\Gamma$
  * `\delta`: $\delta$ OR `\Delta`: $\Delta$
  * etc.

> Omicron is an odd exception; simply the letter o, with no backslash `o`: $o$

There are numerous other options but below is a quick rundown of some of the commonly used scripts. Create an R Markdown document and type each of these with either the inline `$` or new-line `$$`. Compare the rendered document with the input code:

Script | Description | Code | Example
-------|-------------|------|--------
`_` | Subscript | `X_i` | $X_i$ 
`^` | Superscript | `X^2` | $X^2$
`\sim` | Predict | `Y \sim X` | $Y \sim X$
`\times` | Multiply | `X \times Y` | $X \times Y$
`\pm` | Plus or minus | `X \pm Y` | $X \pm Y$
`\neq` | Note equal | `X \neq Y` | $X \neq Y$
`\leq` | Less than or equal | `X \leq Y` | $X \leq Y$
`\geq` | Greater than or equal | `X \geq Y` | $X \geq Y$
`{}` | Group together | `X_{subscript}` | $X_{subscript}$
`\frac` | Fraction | `\frac{X+1}{X-1}` | $\frac{X+1}{X-1}$
`\sum` | Sum | `\sum_{x=1}^{K}` | $\sum_{x=1}^{K}$
`\prod` | Product | `\prod_{x=1}^{K}` | $\prod_{x=1}^{K}$

To see how curly brackets `{}` work, try removing them from the code above, and then re-create your R markdown output.

Here are some more sophisticated examples. Again, try reproducing these in R markdown. If you don't get the same output, then check to see what is different with your code.

```{r, eval=F}
$$\idotsint_V \mu(u_1,\dots,u_k) \,du_1 \dots du_k$$ 
```

will produce:

$$\idotsint_V \mu(u_1,\dots,u_k) \,du_1 \dots du_k$$ 

and 

```{r, eval=F}
$$sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1$$
```

will produce: 

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1$$





Notice the use of special characters with the backslash `\`, along with subscripts `_` and superscripts `_` with the super/subscripted text in curly brackets `{}`

***

## Custom Functions

### General form:

Don't type this out, but read through it. This is called pseudocode. The purpose is to give you a general sense of how to create functions. We have variables (var1 and var2) and we can assign default values (Default1 and Default2), then we put in a bunch of lines of code (Meat and potatoes script) and return an output.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
functionName<-function(var1=Default1,var2=Default2){
  ## Meat and potatoes script
  return(output)
}
```

You should already have a good sense of how functions work from all of the other tutorials/chapters. Now let's work through an example.

### Example function

User inputs two objects; the function outputs a list of functions applied to the inputs

```{r}
my.function<-function(var1=0,var2=0){
  # You can make new variables within a function
  add<-var1+var2
  subt<-var1-var2
  mult<-var1*var2
  div<-var1/var2  
  outlist<-list(input1=var1, input2=var2, 
                addition=add, subtraction=subt, 
                multiplication=mult, division=div)
  # So far, everything is contained within the function. 
  # Use return() to generate output
  return(outlist)
}
```

Note: Nothing output when the funciton is run. This just loads the function into memory.

#### Run the function

Try running the function on its own, with default values:

```{r}
my.function()
```

Now try specifying the input parameters and compare the output.

```{r}
my.function(var1=10,var2=0.1)
my.function(var1=c(1:10),var2=c(10:1))
```

> Protip #1:

Consider annotating long or complex script with `cat()` to help with troubleshooting. The `cat` function is similar to `print` but lets you print directly to screen rather than passing through a data object. Note that `\n` is a 'new line` character; try removing them and compare the output.

```{r}
my.function<-function(var1=0,var2=0){
  cat("\nInput variables:\nvar1 =", var1,"\nvar2 =", var2,"\n")
  cat("\nCalculating functions...\n")
  cat("\nAdding...\n")    

  add<-var1+var2
  
  cat("\nSubtracting...\n")

  subt<-var1-var2
  
  cat("\nMultiplying...\n")
  
  mult<-var1*var2
  
  cat("\nDividing...\n")
  
  div<-var1/var2  
  
  cat("\nGenerating output...\n\n")
  
  outlist<-list(input1=var1, input2=var2, 
                addition=add, subtraction=subt, 
                multiplication=mult, division=div)

  return(outlist)
}

## Run
my.function(var1=10,var2=0.1)
```

Printing text to the screen can slow down your function considerably. A good practice is to provide output as a user-defined option by adding a 'verbose' parameter and an if() statement.

```{r}
my.function<-function(var1=0,var2=0,verbose=FALSE){
  if(verbose==T){
    cat("\nInput variables:\nvar1 =", var1,"\nvar2 =", var2,"\n")
    cat("\nCalculating functions...\n")
    cat("\nAdding...\n")    
  }
  
  add<-var1+var2
  
  if(verbose==T){
    cat("\nSubtracting...\n")
  }
  
  subt<-var1-var2
  
  if(verbose==T){
    cat("\nMultiplying...\n")
  }
  
  mult<-var1*var2
  
  if(verbose==T){
    cat("\nDividing...\n")
  }
  
  div<-var1/var2  
  
  if(verbose==T){
    cat("\nGenerating output...\n")
  }
  
  outlist<-list(input1=var1, input2=var2,
                addition=add, subtraction=subt,
                multiplication=mult, division=div)

  return(outlist)
}

# Run
my.function(var1=10,var2=0.1,verbose=FALSE)
my.function(var1=10,var2=0.1,verbose=TRUE)
```


> Protip #2:

If you have a custom function, theme, script, etc., that you use repeatedly:

  1. Save in a separate file

    * e.g. make new "myfunction.R" file containing just my.function
  
  2. Load using `source("PathName.FileName.R")`

    * e.g. `source("C:/Users/ColauttiLab/myfunction.R")` if save

> Protip #3:

We have already been using functions that somebody else wrote in R.

To see 'under the hood' type a function without the brackets.

> Note: First run `install.packages("ggplot2")` if you don't already have it installed.

```{r}
my.function
library(ggplot2)
qplot
```

## Custom R Package

Most of the general content can be found in Hadley Wickham's [R Packages book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). It goes into detail on almost everything you would need to know to make a package. 

For a quick tutorial, see Hilary Parker's [post](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) on a "cat" function. 


Install packages first and then read on.

```
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr"))
```


Tutorial objectives:

  1) Make a basic package in RStudio and make 1 function.
  2) Make documentation for the function.
  3) Installing the package and input checking. 

### Introduction

When should you use a function vs write a package?

Start with a piece of code, and be sure to add a comment to explain what the code does.
```
# take x, square it and add one to it
y <- x^2 + 1

```

If you are going to use that piece of code multiple times, it's easier to make it into a function and call it, rather than copying and pasting the same cod multiple times. (See functions tutorial [LINK](./5_advanced.html))

```{r}
square_plus<-function(x){
  # take x, square it and add one to it
  y <-x^2 + 1
  return(y)
}
square_plus(2)
square_plus(4)
square_plus(1:10)
```

If you want to use the function across many scripts, you can save the function in its own .R file, and then load it into each script

```
source("/Path/To/CustomScript/Script.R")
```


When you have many functions that you use frequently, you might want to make your own R package so that you can load all the functions easily and quickly. This also makes it easy to share the functions.

```
square_plus<-function(x){
  # take x, square it and add one to it
  y <- x^2 + 1
  return(y)
}

cube_plus<-function(x){
  # take x, cube it and add one to it
  y <-x^3 + 1
  return(y)
}

quartic_plus<-function(x){
  # raise x to the power of 4 and add one to it
  y <-x^4 + 1
  return(y)
}
```

### Getting started

R Studio makes it easy to create your own packages for R. Once you have installed devtools (see above), create a new R package in R Studio

    File -> New Project -> New Directory -> R Package 
    
You can also use the "R Package" option but delete the NAMESPACE file as it will be automatically generated later.
Give the package a name and then click create. 

RStudio should load and there will be a file structure with several files and two folders, "R" and "man".

The "R" folder is for code, and there is a hello.R file in it. Save all of your custom functions here.

The "man" folder is for manual pages, the documents that show up when you use the ? for help `?some_function`.


### Add functions

We are going to make a function to get public references from the Crossref API. 
Crossref is one of the organizations for Digital Object Identifiers and is frequently the one used for scientific journals. 
Crossref has "metadata" on digital objects such as type of object, author, dates etc etc.

We can access this information through the Crossref page. 

For example, the link below shows the result of a search for the title of a paper by Primack and Miller-Rushing (2011).

https://search.crossref.org/?q=Broadening+the+study+of+phenology+and+climate+change

The DOI for the first paper (by Primack & Miller-Rushing) is "10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03773.x"

Clicking on the "Actions" button for this paper, and then "Metadata as JSON", brings up a json file including citation information, and also citations for the papers referenced in the paper. 

There's been times where we read a paper and then go through the references of the paper, especially for literature reviews/meta-analyses. Automating the extraction of references from a paper of interest might be useful.

We can access the json file in R using the doi and using the Crossref api (documentation [LINK](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc)).

Doing this will give us a list of the citations:

```{r}
# download jsonlite to parse json files
library(jsonlite)
url<-"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03773.x"
result<-fromJSON(url)
```

`result` is a list containing a variety of information

```{r}
names(result)
```

`result$message$reference` is a data frame of citations containing 17 references that we can extract this. 

```{r}
references<-as.data.frame(result$message$reference)
```

This can be easily writen to csv or other formats. 

But we can also make this a function for any DOI of interest. 

```
get_work_references<-function(DOI){
  url<-paste0("https://api.crossref.org/works/",DOI)
  result<-fromJSON(url)
  return(as.data.frame(result$message$reference))
}
```

We can save the script above in the R folder to make it part of the package.

Of course, we would want to add more functions in order to make this a useful package.

If we want to run the function, we can use the `source()` function as described above. But as a package this still lack two important pieces:

  1. Documentation for this function (and any other functions we add)
  2. A library that would let us load all functions using the `library()` function 

### Adding documentation

The first piece of documentation is the DESCRIPTION file. There are several fields to fill in for this.

  1. The __package name__ is already filled automatically. 
  2. We should add a __title__ (ie. This Package Gets References).
  3. Change the `Author` to `Authors@R` and add yourself as the author and creator. 

```
Authors@R: person("First Name", "Last Name", 
        email="email@email.com", role=c("aut", cre))

# Two authors
Authors@R: c(person("First Name", "Last Name", 
        email="email@email.com", role=c("aut", cre)),
             person("Second person name", "second person last name", 
             email="email@email.com", role="aut"))

```
  4. Write a description: 

        Interfacing with Crossref's API to get citation information using DOI. 
        This package uses jsonlite and contains only one function.
        etc...

  5. Choose one of the public licenses such as GPL-3, MIT etc. (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses))

Save the DESCRIPTION file.

### Add a Manual

The `roxygen2` package can be used to make manuals for R packages. This greatly simplifies the writing process, which otherwise would be written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). The `roxygen2` package allows us to make comments directly in the script, and then `roxygen2` automatically generates the manual pages from these comments. 

First, take out any library(*) commands and use packagename::function() for any functions from other libraries. Read R Packages - R code for more details on why. 

When writing your comments, follow this logic:

  + Roxygen2 commands start with `#'`. 
  + The first line is automatically the title field and should cover only one line. 
  + The next text paragraph goes into the description. The usage field is automatically generated. 
  + Use `@param` tags for arguments. (Only 1 in this case). 
  + Use the next line to write a longer description. 
  + Use `@return` to write what is expected output and `@example` to write example code that will be run when creating the man page. 
  + We also want to use a `@export` tag so that the function will be available for use when the library is loaded. 
  + We need to add details such as description, useage, arguments. 
  + The script would look something like this: 

```
#' Takes a DOI and returns references for the object.
#'
#' This function queries the Crossref API to obtain a data frame 
of references for the DOI. We use the paste0 function from base 
and the fromJSON function from jsonlite.
#'
#' @param DOI String. Digital object identifier.
#'
#' @return data frame of references.
#' @example
#' get_work_references("10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03773.x")
#' @export

get_work_references<-function(DOI){
  url<-paste0("https://api.crossref.org/works/",DOI)
  result<-jsonlite::fromJSON(url)
  return(as.data.frame(result$message$reference))
}

```

Save the file and use `devtools::document().`

We will now have a NAMESPACE file, and a new file within the man folder. The NAMESPACE file shows the function we have which will be available in the environment when the library is loaded.

Open `get_work_references.Rd` and then click preview to see how it looks.

However, our man page is a bit dull, and lacks the links most pages have. We have to add the links using code. For example, linking the paste0 function will be `\code{\link[base]{paste0}}`. 

Use `document()` again. Now the functions are in monospace font. The actual links only appear when the package is built.

We can use the "CHECK" button on the "Build Pane" to check for any issues in the package. 

We did not import the jsonlite package. To do this, go back to the DESCRIPTION file and add:

``` Imports:
      jsonlite
```

Another CHECK will tell you that the package `curl` is required. Add this to the imports as well. 

### Installing the package

Once you pass the check, click "Install and Restart" to install the package. The package should be in your "Packages" pane.

Doing `?get_work_references` will bring up the help page with working links. We can successfully run the example. But if input is not a character, the function doesn't work.

### Input checking

You cannot account for every possible scenario where the function doesn't work. Or there are certain variables you know have to be in a specific form. 

You can add checks for inputs within the function. 

For example, the DOI should be a character string. We can add a test for the input and stop the function with an error if the input isn't a character string.

```
get_work_references<-function(DOI){
  if (!is.character(DOI)) stop(" 'DOI' must be a character string")
  url<-paste0("https://api.crossref.org/works/",DOI)
  result<-jsonlite::fromJSON(url)
  return(as.data.frame(result$message$reference))
}


```

Re-install and you have a working package!

### Make it public

Before going public:

  1. Create a public GitHub repository and push your project
  2. Flesh out documentation and meta-data
  3. Error checking with `devtools` library
    * `spell_check()`
    * `check_rhub()` -- use rhub to check for errors. [More about RHub](https://builder.r-hub.io/about.html). 
    * `check_win_release()` -- check for errors on Windows with latest release version of R
    * `check_win_devel()` -- check for errors on Windows with latest pre-release of R
    * `release()` -- release to the world!
  4. Tag the latest release on GitHub
